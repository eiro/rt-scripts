this file is mixing markdown documentations and m4 definitions.

# TODO

* complains loudly when variables not set
* _DO_NOT_EDIT_WARNING_ must name the input file ? 

# DOCUMENTATION

those macros have to be set when running this file

* _MAILGATE_BIN_ = path to the rt-mailgate 
* _MAILGATE_URL_ = url  to the rt  
* _MAILGATE_DOM_ = addr domains

this file defines macros that ease the production of email aliases
to contact mailgates.

# DESIGN NOTES: 

* why not tt2 or erb or (the template engine for python afficionados)? because we don't need them!
  (if we need some of them at some point, maybe use mason because it's the
  template engine used by rt. and yes: i don't give a shit about chef!)

# M4 DEFINITIONS

changequote([,])
define(_DO_NOT_EDIT_WARNING_,[
# /!\ this file or section was generated with rt-mailgate-aliases.
#     PLEASE DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY AND READ THE DOC
])

##  rt_mailgate

create a new alias to the mailgate with
    $1 : email address of the alias
    $2 : action to perform (comment, correspond, ...)
    $3 : the queue where the action takes place

define(rt_mailgate,$1[[]ifdef([_MAILGATE_DOM_],@_MAILGATE_DOM_)]: "|_MAILGATE_BIN_ \
    --debug \
    --action $2 \
    --queue  $3 \
    --url _MAILGATE_URL_")

## rt_correspond and rt_comment

those are just wrappers around rt_mailgate with the name of the action to perform. please see rt_mailgate definition/doc.

define(rt_correspond,[rt_mailgate($1,correspond,$2)])
define(rt_comment,[rt_mailgate($1-comment,comment,$2)])

# rt_queue

basically, a queue is a default addr with 

rt_queue creates both corresponding and comment aliases for the same queue.
    $1 : address prefix (used as it for the correspond command)
    $2 : the name of the queue

define(rt_queue,[
rt_correspond($1,$2)

rt_comment($1,$2)
])

define([rt_domain],[define([_MAILGATE_DOM_],$1)] 
)
